In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with loosely typed variables and implicit type conversions.  Consider this code:

```php
$count = "10apples";
$total = $count * 2;
```

You might expect a type error or a notice. However, PHP's loose typing silently converts the string "10apples" to an integer 10, and performs the multiplication. The result will be 20, masking the underlying data error.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues.  A slightly modified example could result in `0` if the string can't be converted to a number.

Another example is using `==` instead of `===` when comparing values.  `==` performs type juggling, whereas `===` checks for both value and type equality.
